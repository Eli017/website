        While he was a freshman, Eli designed a collage using Jython.<br>
        The original photo, a single spiraling tower, was altered in<br>
        multiple ways. With the Jython code, the picture was mirrored,<br>
        shrunk, darkened, and made the photo with sepia tones.<br>

        Another project that Eli worked on was a text adventure through<br>
        Python. In this program, the user is prompted to type in answers<br>
        based upon the room they are in. The game begins by recording<br>
        the players name. Overall, this did improve skills regarding<br>
        global variables and how they are altered by the player.<br>
